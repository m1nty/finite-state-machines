## Finite State Machine Design for the PS/2 and LCD Interfaces

<a name="objective"></a>
### Objective

To understand the importance of finite state machines (FSMs) in digital systems design. Gain experience with coding styles for FSMs and implement digital systems using the PS/2 and LCD peripherals on the DE2-115 board. PS/2 is a serial port used to interface a keyboard or a mouse to a personal computer. LCD is a low-power/flat-panel display that uses liquid crystals and it is predominant in embedded devices.

### Online workflow

- [PS/2 keyboard codes](ps2-keyboard-codes.md)
- [LCD codes](lcd-codes.md)
